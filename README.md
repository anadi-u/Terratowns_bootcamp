# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

We are going to use Semantic Versioning for tagging in this project.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The format would look like this; **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.0`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
